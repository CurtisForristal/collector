### Description
A video game collection app...HOW ORIGINAL!  This web app will allow you to create a new account, add new games to your colleciton by searching GiantBomb.com's rebust game video datbase, select the platforms you own that game on, and display your collection for all the world to see.  You can also view a list of all registered users and view their collections as well.

An incredibly unoriginal idea I know, but the exact content was beside the point for me.  The creation of this app provided an excellent means for me to gain additional practice an many areas, such as ...

* Node
* Express
* MongoDB and Mongoose
* RESTful Routing
* API usage
* Authentication
* Bootstrap and CSS3
* jQuery
* and other additional frameworks


### Installation
Pretty straightforward.  Requires a local setup of Node, Express, and MondoDB.  Install the npm packages and bob's your uncle.
